# MedX

This was originally built following a tutorial to learn the MERN tech stack, then modified to be a prototype submission for HealthHack.

The goal is to simulate a Quora-like environment, where users can post queries regarding their medical statuses on a forum. Coupled with a modification of the Chrome extension (to be implemented), users can receive an immediate AI-generated response. Users given the permission of "Doctors" can then reply to forum posts if need be.

This app is not meant to be used commercially, and is only built for practice and submission purposes.
